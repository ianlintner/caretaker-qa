# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

Initial release. Ships the scaffolding for a live QA harness for `ianlintner/caretaker`.

### Added

- `qa-agent scan` CLI — fetches NVD / OSV / GHSA advisories + security RSS, matches them against a watchlist, emits a Markdown brief.
- LangGraph-based relevance pipeline: `fetch → match → judge → report`.
- Deterministic matcher with CPE + package + repo-topic matching; LLM judge only invoked on ambiguous items.
- `watchlist.yml` seeded with the caretaker fleet (audio_engineer, python_dsa, kubernetes-apply-vscode, flashcards, Example-React-AI-Chat-App) plus three popular OSS projects (langchain, fastapi, axios).
- CI workflow: ruff format + ruff check + mypy --strict + pytest (80% coverage floor) + CodeQL.
- Nightly workflow: runs the agent at 02:00 UTC, commits the brief into `reports/`, opens a PR.
- Caretaker maintainer.yml pinned to v0.16.0 with Wave A features on (fix-ladder, guardrails, attribution telemetry).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Caretaker pin upgraded from v0.18.0 to v0.19.1 (fleet-wide upgrade defaults: auto_approve + auto_ready_drafts; caretaker:reviewed label pre-creation fix).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Caretaker pin upgraded from v0.16.0 to v0.17.0 (QA-scenario dispatch suppression, empty-PR-body close, Copilot action_required escalation suppression).
